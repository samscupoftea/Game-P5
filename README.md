# Game-P5

Game Title: Egg In Space .

This game will be based structurally on the popular game "Flappy Bird". But teh styling and main character will be of the theme of Star Wars and Baby Yoda.

I will use JS for the functionality and interactivity of the game. CSS will also play an important role in re-defining the game theme and identity.

Planning process:

1 - First I will create the game element div classes for "Game", "Block", "Hole" and "Character".
2 - Using these div's I shall style them accordingly using CSS. The Game div will be used to create the width, height and setting of the game itself.
3 - Using CSS I will use @keyframes to create an animation of the block's going from right to left of the screen.
4 - For the majority of the functionality I will use Javascript.
5 - In JS I will need to declare variables that relate to the div's I created in HTML and CSS. These will remain unchanged so I will us Const instead of Let for these. To target those specific elements in the DOM i will use 'getElementId'.
I will also create variables for jumping and that counts the number of blocks we pass.
6 - Next I need to add an eventListener to track the hole element and use math.Random to cause the hole to appear different places (order random places) each time.

This is where I hit my ability ceiling with JS and although I found example code to make the rest work, I feel uncomfortable submitting that as my own work.
